# GPT Storytale

Create controllable story sequences with transformers that can be used in user-evaluation studies of text-to-visualisation pipelines.


![Overview of the Graph-to-Text-Pipeline](figs/overview.png)

## Getting started

GPT Storytale has been tested on python 3.10. You will need to install the required packages. Using a virtual environment is recommended. e.g.
```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv          # set up the virtual env
source myvenv/bin/activate      # activate the virtual env (Linux) (On Windows: myvenv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt # install the required packages
```

You will also need to set up your OpenAI API key. You can do this by creating a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and adding the following line:
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```
(see `.env-template` for an example)

## Usage

To run the GPT Storytale system:

1. Generate a story sequence:
```bash
python src/generate_story.py --input your_input.json --output output_folder
```

2. Evaluate the generated sequences:
```bash
python src/evaluate.py --story_path output_folder
```

For detailed examples and parameter options, see the [examples](examples/) directory.
